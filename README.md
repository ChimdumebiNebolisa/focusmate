# FocusMate üéØ

A productivity assistant that helps users stay focused using accountability sessions, task management, and minimal distractions.

---

## üß† Overview

FocusMate pairs accountability, timers, and task tracking to help people maintain focus during work or study sessions. It creates a structured environment that encourages productive habits and measurable progress.

---

## YOUR PROJECT README:

- Problem: staying consistent with deep work is hard without structure or accountability.  
- Solution: a simple session‚Äëbased workflow (plan ‚Üí focus ‚Üí reflect) with tasks, timers, and progress logs.  
- Users: students, developers, and professionals who want fewer distractions and better output.  
- Outcome: increased session completion, clearer goals, and a repeatable focus ritual.

## üöÄ Features

- Task list with due dates and priorities  
- Session timer (Pomodoro or custom durations)  
- Focus mode (minimal UI; optional blocker integrations)  
- Start/End check-ins (goal + reflection)  
- Session history and simple analytics  
- Light/Dark theme

## üìå Usage Workflow

1) Log in or create an account  
2) Add tasks for the current session

## RECRUITEMENT GATHERING

- Identify primary user groups (students, junior devs, indie hackers) and their friction points.  
- Capture user stories and acceptance criteria to bound scope.  
- Validate minimal feature set via quick clickable prototype.

--ACCOMPLISHED "user pain-point discovery" THROUGH "surveys + 10 user interviews" USING "structured interview guide" 
--ACCOMPLISHED "MVP scope definition" THROUGH "story mapping workshop" USING "MoSCoW prioritization"

---

## ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

- Define system responsibilities (timer, tasks, sessions, analytics).  
- Draft component hierarchy and state model.  
- Design minimal, distraction-free UI with clear CTAs.  
- Map API endpoints and data model.

--ACCOMPLISHED "session lifecycle clarity" THROUGH "sequence diagrams" USING "C4 + Mermaid modeling" 
--ACCOMPLISHED "UI consistency" THROUGH "design tokens" USING "Tailwind config + radix scale"

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

- Build React views and reusable components.  
- Implement REST endpoints for tasks/sessions.  
- Add auth guard and role-free permissions (MVP).  
- Persist sessions and expose summary aggregates.

--ACCOMPLISHED "stable task CRUD" THROUGH "service layer abstraction" USING "repository pattern"
--ACCOMPLISHED "reliable timers" THROUGH "server-authoritative timestamps" USING "drift-compensation logic"

---

## TESTING

- Unit tests for core utilities and reducers.  
- Integration tests for API endpoints.  
- E2E smoke tests for the core flow (login ‚Üí start ‚Üí finish).  
- Manual QA checklist for UX fit and accessibility.

--ACCOMPLISHED "regression safety" THROUGH "CI test suite" USING "Vitest/Jest + Supertest"
--ACCOMPLISHED "critical path assurance" THROUGH "E2E runs on PRs" USING "Playwright"

---

## DEPLOYMENT

- CI/CD pipeline: lint, test, build, preview.  
- Deploy backend (Render/Fly.io) and frontend (Vercel).  
- Environment segregation: dev ‚Üí preview ‚Üí prod.  
- Post-deploy smoke test and health checks.

--ACCOMPLISHED "repeatable releases" THROUGH "pipeline templates" USING "GitHub Actions" 
--ACCOMPLISHED "faster rollbacks" THROUGH "versioned images" USING "Docker + tags" 

---

## MAINTENANCE

- Logging and monitoring with minimal overhead.  
- Error reporting pipeline (Sentry/OpenTelemetry).  
- Backups for DB; rotation policies.  
- Groom backlog; ship small improvements regularly.

--ACCOMPLISHED "issue visibility" THROUGH "error budget dashboard" USING "SLO tracking"  
--ACCOMPLISHED "operational resilience" THROUGH "nightly backups" USING "managed DB snapshot"
