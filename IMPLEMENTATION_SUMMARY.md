### 3. Updated Action Tooltips

**File:** `focusmate/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`

All action button tooltips now accurately reflect current capabilities:

1. **Summarize**: "AI-powered text summarization (Chrome 138+)."
2. **Clean**: "⚠️ Writer API in Early Preview - Not yet available."
3. **Extract Tasks**: "Pattern-based task detection (no AI required)."
4. **Translate**: "AI translation - Multiple languages supported."

**Location:** Lines 17-47

### 4. Landing Page Updates

**File:** `focusmate/src/components/AboutSection.tsx`

#### Updated Feature Description:
Changed "AI-Powered Clarity" description from:
> "Clean up messy notes or speech with Chrome's on-device AI summarizer and rewriter."

To:
> "Summarize text and translate to 7 languages with Chrome's built-in AI (Chrome 138+). Task extraction uses smart pattern matching."

This accurately reflects:
- Summarization works fully
- Translation supports 7 languages
- Task extraction uses pattern matching (not AI)
- Writer/Rewriter not mentioned (since unavailable)

**Location:** Lines 8-9

## What Users Will See

### Translation Feature
Users now have granular control over translations:
1. **Target Language Dropdown**: Choose from 7 languages
2. **Translation Mode Dropdown**: Choose tone (academic, concise, creative, conversational)
3. Both options work together for customized translations

### Writer API Status
- Yellow warning badge (!) on "Clean" button
- Tooltip explains it's in early preview
- When clicked, returns helpful message about API unavailable
- Suggests alternatives (use Summarizer or integrate OpenAI/Claude)

### Extract Tasks Feature
- Tooltip clearly states "Pattern-based task detection (no AI required)"
- Uses regex to find:
  - Bullet points (-, *, •)
  - Numbered lists (1., 2., etc.)
  - Task markers (TODO, Task:)
  - Action verbs (need to, should, must, etc.)

### Landing Page
- Accurate description of capabilities
- Mentions 7 language support
- Clarifies Chrome 138+ requirement
- No misleading promises about unavailable features
