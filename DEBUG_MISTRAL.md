# Debugging Mistral AI Integration

## Quick Test Instructions

1. **Open your browser's Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Try processing text with Mistral AI**
4. **Look for the log**: `OpenRouter API response:` in the console
5. **Share the log output** so I can see what's being returned

## Common Issues

### Issue: Blank output
This usually means:
- The API response format is different than expected
- The model might not be returning content properly
- There could be an API key issue

### What to check:
1. Console logs will show the actual API response
2. Network tab in DevTools shows the API call
3. The error message (if any) in the output area

## Next Steps

Please:
1. Open the app in your browser (http://localhost:5173)
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Switch to Mistral AI and process your text
5. Copy and share the console logs

This will help me diagnose the exact issue!
