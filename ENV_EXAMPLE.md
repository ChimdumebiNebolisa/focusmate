# Environment Configuration

## Setting up Mistral AI

To use Mistral AI, create a `.env` file in the `focusmate` directory with the following content:

```env
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key from https://openrouter.ai/

## Getting Your API Key

1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to your API keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key and paste it into the `.env` file

Note: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, so your API key won't be committed to version control.
